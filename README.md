# MIPS Assembly Repository for Low-Level Processor Applications

This repository contains a collection of **MIPS assembly programs** designed for low-level processor implementations and simulations. Using the **MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)**, these examples demonstrate how to create and test processor-level functionalities, providing a hands-on approach to understanding computer architecture and assembly programming.

## Purpose

The repository aims to:
- Illustrate core concepts of MIPS assembly language.
- Demonstrate low-level applications for processor design, such as arithmetic units, control logic, and memory management.
- Provide reusable examples for students and developers working on MIPS-based processors or learning assembly language programming.

## Features

- **Low-Level Processor Applications**:
  - Arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, multiplication).
  - Logical and bitwise operations.
  - Memory management and stack operations.
  - Control structures like branching and looping.
- **Tested on MARS**:
  - Programs are designed to run on the [MARS Simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/), which provides a rich debugging environment for MIPS.
- **Documented Examples**:
  - Each program includes comments explaining the purpose and functionality.
- **Example of Processor Implementation**:
  - Modules demonstrating how to emulate processor components, such as an ALU or memory unit.
